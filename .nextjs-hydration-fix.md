# Hydration Error Fix Guide

## Common Causes:
1. localStorage access during SSR
2. Date.now() or Math.random() in render
3. Browser-only APIs (window, document)
4. Conditional rendering based on client state
5. Animation differences

## Fixed:
✅ localStorage wrapped in typeof window checks
✅ ChatWidget only renders after mount
✅ TerminalHero typing animation uses suppressHydrationWarning
✅ Admin panel conditional rendering fixed
✅ generateSessionId handles SSR

## If still getting errors:
1. Check browser console for exact error
2. Look for components using:
   - Date.now() in render
   - Math.random() in render
   - window/document without checks
   - Conditional rendering without mounted state
